My name is Kyra. 

I have more lines from The Office memorized than I should.
I can't seem to stop eating unreasonably spicy food. 
And I have a soft spot for listening to vinyl records. It's such a treat... From the unpackaging of the record, to gently loading it into the player, and even listening to the distinct few seconds of static before the music begins to play.
